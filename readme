## Microblogging

**About this project**
Microblogging is a simple web application that can be used as a blog. It supports reading, writing ( with images ) , and commenting on blog posts. It also supports login via passwords and Google OAuth 2.0.

This project was made as the Round 2 Task for CRUx Inductions.

**Installing and Running**
You must have the latest version of Node.js, MongoDB and Git installed.
 1. Cone this repo using `git clone git@github.com:hereisdx/blog.git`
 2. Enter the project using `cd blog`
 3. Install dependencies using `npm install`
 4. In MongoDB create a new database named `microblogging`
 5. In microblogging, create empty collections, namely `blogpost` `account` and `googleuser`
 6. Fill the `blogpost` collection with a few sample blogs to prevent errors:`{"_id":"5c52f3f05f85f6668ffb8b0e","heading":"Node.js Tutorial","author":"Divyanshu Agrawal","body":" Well the uscipit eniam quo facere quibusdam earum iste placeat debitis nostrum.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

 7. That's it. Once you have populated the `blogpost` collection with the above sample data, you can follow the next step to start the server.
 8. To start the HTTP server, run `DEBUG=blog:* npm start`
